        <p>Here are a few Recent Project I do and Learn:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</li>
          <li>
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since
            the 1500s
          </li>
          <li>
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
            make a type specimen book
          </li>
          <li>
            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
            electronic typesetting
          </li>
          <li>
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
            with the release
          </li>
        </ul>
